  macOS Client

In this section, we are using an Apple macOS computer as the L2TP client.

1. Add a VPN connection in the network settings.

System Preferences > Network > "+"

Interface: VPN
VPN Type: PSK L2TP over IPSec
Service name: VPN (L2TP)
2. Adjust the newly created L2TP over IPsec interface.

System Preferences > Network > VPN L2TP

Configuration: Default
Server Address: <OUTSIDE_IP_ADDR>
Account User Name: ${NEW_VPN_USER}

3. Add the authentication settings.

System Preferences > Network > VPN L2TP > Authentication Settings

User Authentication: ${NEW_VPN_PASSWD}
Machine Authentication: ${VPNPSK}
```

for Windows 10, follow:

a decent ssh config for the environment:

Host nuc*.maas
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
  IdentityFile <use private ssh key in 1password for ims-admin>
  User ubuntu
  Port 22

Host maas
  Hostname <ip_addr>
  IdentityFile <use private ssh key in 1password for ims-admin>
  Port 22

Place the following script in `/etc/ppp/ip-up` and make sure to `chmod 755 /etc/ppp/ip-up`

:FROM HERE

#!/bin/bash
#
# this script should be placed in /etc/ppp/ip-up
# It is run after VPN is started.
#
# Need to eval for the correct destination VPN IP before adding routes for it,
# this is run after every VPN connect..so we need to eval for the server VPN IP
#
# The parameters given to the script:
#
# $1: The VPN interface (e.g. ppp0)
# $2: Unknown, blank
# $3  Unknown, 0
# $4: IP of the VPN server
# $5: VPN gateway address
# $6: Regular (non-vpn) gateway for your lan connections
